I created PlanetTrack because of my great interest in Astronomy and to help educate people about the planets and solar system. This app is a compilation of information from several different sources that have been merged together to allow users a simple interface for educating themselves about our place in the universe. As I was stargazing one evening, I realized that the planets are in constant motion around the sun. I wanted to create something that displayed and updated their distances live. As a result, PlanetTrack was born.

The “PlanetTrack” feature (screenshot below) is the heart of this application. I already had known that the distance between the planets is constantly changing because they are in different orbits around the sun and are moving at different speeds. However, whenever you look up the distance between the planets, you always get the same mean distance between them and not the actual live distance they are from each other right now. For example, when you search online for the distance between Earth and Mars, you get the result of 33,900,000 miles. A little confusing, especially considering that this answer is only correct once every few years. What about when Earth and Mars are on different sides of the sun?  I wanted to clear this up to users and show that these distances actually vary greatly over time. I found an awesome data source to get these actual distances at any given time through NASA’s SPICE Geometry Calculator. I knew that this would be an excellent way to retrieve and display the data live within my app. Due to the overwhelming size and complexity of these distance results, I created a JSON file online for my app to fetch and display the data. These distances are then displayed on the app live.

Another thing that people love about space is the beautiful photographs captured by spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope. This is why I decided to include an image gallery in my app to allow users to view these awesome images along with NASA’s captions containing detailed information about the images. These high-definition images really keep the user’s attention and hopefully inspire interest in the beauty contained in the wonders of space.

Do you know how much you would weigh on the Sun? Due to the intense gravity of it, you would weigh about 28 times as much as you weigh on Earth. This is just one of the many solar system facts I included in the Solar System Facts section of my app. Other facts show users detailed information about each planet, 10 facts about each planet, and other relevant topics. For example, you can learn why we always see the same side of the moon, view current missions being conducted by NASA, and even learn about the search for extraterrestrial life. My aim is that these features will hopefully arouse a lifelong interest in astronomy and desire to stay in touch with our progress in understanding our place in the universe.
